This is my first ever C project I did as a part of my 'Structured Programming Course' in my first semester of university.
I did this with very basic knowledge of C, so there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of the code being simple.
If you have any improvements regarding the projects please leave your comments down below as I look forward to get better as a programmer!
All functions and the main function itself were written by me. A teammate of mine added in only the system("cls") and getch().
